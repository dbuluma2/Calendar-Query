# Copy this whole folder from course-content to your private repo

# Calendar Query repo files

- _calendar-query-description.pdf_: Contains project description and timeline 
- _calendar-query-assessment.pdf_: Contains project assessment criteria
- _cq-report_your-name.qmd_: Report template with sample code to get you started. Edit this file (in your repo) directly for your report. There should be only one qmd file in your repo; let GitHub manage version control! Remember you can always see the original version of the template in the course-content repo.

When you are ready to submit your report, save the final PDF as _cq_report_your-name.pdf_, replacing your-name with your last name.
